# Bob the Blob
A Unity game

## Storyline
You are a blob - some type of bacteria that is capable of destroying viruses. Someday in the future, you (and potentially your team) acknowledged that a new type of virus appeared out of nowhere (being developed???) and your mission is to destroy them before they get spread out to the world. However, they will get stronger (evolve) over time, so it is your job to destroy them as fast as possible - you might fail your mission otherwise.
